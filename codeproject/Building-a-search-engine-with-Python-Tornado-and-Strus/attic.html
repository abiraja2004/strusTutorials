<p>
Information retrieval has various facets. In general one can say that information retrieval is
the attempt to satisfy an information need, described with a query. This query may include some
context information like data from a user profile or assessments of previous attempts to
answer the query. Strus introduces 3 type of bricks to program a query evaluation:
<ol>
<li><b>Query expressions</b>: Query expressions are either terms or a n-ary join operation of
argument expressions. Internally any query expression is implemented as iterator on the set of
pairs (d,p), where d is an internal document number and p a discrete position number.
Query expressions can have variables attached. Variables can be referenced by summarizers
to extract data from documents.
</li>
<li><b>Weighting functions</b>: Weighting functions are parameterised functions on sets of query
expression that assign a numeric weight to a document.
</li>
<li><b>Summarizers</b>: Summarizers are parameterised functions on sets of query
expressions that return weighted items extracted from documents.
</li>
</ol>
</p>



This tutorial will first show how a classical statistical search of the search term is done with 'BM25' as
weighting scheme on this collection.
In a second step we show the capabilities of strus to do information extraction. We extract an item
('continent') from each matching document, accumulate the weights and present a statistical ranking of these items
extracted.


<h3>The analyzer configuration</h3>
<p>The document analyzer configuration (in the file countries.ana of the docker image) 
used for indexing the documents looks as follows:</p>
<pre>
[Document]
        doc = /list/doc;

[SearchIndex]
        word = convdia(en):stem(en):lc  word  /list/doc//();
        sent = empty punctuation(en,".") /list/doc//();
        country_var = empty content {position=succ} /list/doc/country@id;
        capital_var = empty content {position=succ} /list/doc/capital@id;
        continent_var = empty content {position=succ} /list/doc/continent@id;

[ForwardIndex]
        orig = orig split /list/doc//();
        country = text content {position=succ} /list/doc/country@id;
        capital = text content {position=succ} /list/doc/capital@id;
        continent = text content {position=succ} /list/doc/continent@id;

[Attribute]
        docid = text content /list/doc@id;

[Aggregator]
        doclen = count(word);
</pre>
<p>The configuration has the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Document</b> <p> All documents inserted for this tutorial are in one file. The section <b>Document</b>
declares what declares with a selection expression, what entity declares one document in such a file.</p>
</li>
<li><b>SearchIndex</b> <p> The search index section declares the terms inserted into the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index">inverted index</a>. 
To each term we assign a type (left side of the assignment). On the right side of the assignment we
declare how the values are produced that are inserted into the storage. You can read this chain of 
declarations from right to left. The rightmost expression selects the entities from the document.
Then we optionally specify for items that do not get their own position assigned, to which term 
(succeeding 'succ' or preceeding 'pred') the position is bound, e.g. "{position=succ}". 
Then the tokenizer is specified, e.g. 'content', 'word', 'punctuation'.
The leftmost expression specifies how the tokens are normalized before they are inserted,
e.g. 'text', 'empty', 'convdia(en):stem(en):lc'.
In our example we have 5 term types declared:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>word</b> <p> The words for search.</p></li>
<li><b>sent</b> <p> End of sentence markers.</p></li>
<li><b>country_var</b> <p> Placeholder to reference for extraction of country names.</p></li>
<li><b>capital_var</b> <p> Placeholder to reference for extraction of capital names.</p></li>
<li><b>continent_var</b> <p> Placeholder to reference for extraction of continent names.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>ForwardIndex</b> <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Search_engine_indexing&redirect=no#The_forward_index">forward index</a>
section declares the features that can be extracted by summarizers. We declare 4 of them:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>orig</b> <p> The original terms of the document for abstracting in the result ranklist.<p></li>
<li><b>country</b> <p> The countries referenced by variables.<p></li>
<li><b>capital</b> <p> The capitals referenced by variables.<p></li>
<li><b>continent</b> <p> The continent referenced by variables.<p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Attribute</b> <p> The document attributes. Here we have only docid identifying the document.</p></li>
<li><b>Aggregator</b> <p> The aggregators for statistical values. We have to declare <b>doclen</b> because
BM25 requires it.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>





<h3>Insert the documents</h3>
<p>
The command to insert the documents looks as follows.
</p>
<pre>
strusInsert -s "path=storage" countries.ana countries.xml
</pre>
<p>
you get
</p>
<pre>
inserted 195 documents (total 195), 0 transactions open     
done
</pre>
